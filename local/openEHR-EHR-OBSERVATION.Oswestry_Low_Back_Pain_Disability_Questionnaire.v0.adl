indicated apart from advice on lifting sitting and exercise.
21%-40%: moderate disability: The patient experiences more pain and difficulty with sitting, lifting and
standing. Travel and social life are more difficult and they may be
disabled from work. Personal care, sexual activity and sleeping are not
grossly affected and the patient can usually be managed by
conservative means.
41%-60%: severe disability: Pain remains the main problem in this group but activities of daily
living are affected. These patients require a detailed investigation.
61%-80%: crippled: Back pain impinges on all aspects of the patient's life. Positive
intervention is required.
81%-100%: These patients are either bed-bound or exaggerating their symptoms.">
